# The Breakfast Bar

I took [this design](https://egyomrey.github.io/Breakfast-Bar/Mockup%20from%20Dribbble.jpg) from Dribble.com and built a single page website with it. [Try it](https://egyomrey.github.io/Breakfast-Bar/build/index.html):arrow_upper_right:

## How to use this project?

All the source code is in the `src` folder. The minified version is in the `build` folder.

- Clone this repository with Git using this command in your console
`git clone https://github.com/EGYOMREY/Breakfast-Bar.git`

- You can also fork or directly download it

If you'd like to develop it further, dive into the project's folder and type `npm install` so you can install and work with the dependencies I used. Then, type `gulp` in your command line and browsersync will open a tab pointing to your `http://localhost:3000/`. The files you are going to be working in, are in the `src` folder.

If you only want to check the page in your computer, go to `build` and open `index.html`.

### Tools used

- Preprocessor: SCSS
- Tooling automation: Gulp (gulp-sass, browser-sync, gulp-uglify, gulp-concat, gulp-sourcemaps, gulp-autoprefixer, gulp-htmlmin)
- Pictures were obtained from [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/en/).
- Used [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com) to identify the main font of the design and to download the webfont. Also Google fonts to use Roboto.
- Markup validated with [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org)


#### Motivation for this project

I like building websites and I saw a design I really liked and wanted to make a Live and responsive version of it.
